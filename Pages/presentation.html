            <h1>Presentation</h1>
            <p> Hey! My name is Filip Rydberg and i am currently studying Computer Science at the Linneus University in Kalmar.<br>
                On my freetime i like to hang out with friends, watch movies, play games and exercise.            
            </p>
            
            <p> When I graduated from highschool in 2013 I moved to Norway for six months.<br>
            I worked in a meat factory called "Fatland AS" and i really enjoyed it but I had<br>
            to move back to Sweden in march 2014 because four of my friends didn't want to stay<br>
            and the rent of the apartment was basically to high for me to live there alone<br>
            </p>
           
            <p>When I got back to Sweden I started to work in a similiar company, a chicken factory<br>
            but I hated that job (without mentioning any names) so thats when I decided that I wanted to start studying.<br>
            Computers and almost everything related to it has been an hobby since i was a kid<br>
            so I went in that direction and applied for this current program.<br>
