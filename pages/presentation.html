            <p> Hey! My name is Filip Rydberg and I am currently studying Computer Science at the Linneus University in Kalmar.
                <strong>On my freetime i like to:</strong>

           </ul>
            
            <p> When I graduated from highschool in 2013 I moved to Norway for six months.
            I worked in a meat factory called <a href="http://www.fatland.no/newsread/news.asp?n=5148">Fatland AS</a>
            and i really enjoyed it but I had
            to move back to Sweden in march 2014 because four of my friends didn't want to stay
            and the rent of the apartment was basically to high for me to live there alone.
            </p>
           
                <p>When I got back to Sweden I started to work in a similiar company, a chicken factory
                but I hated that job (without mentioning any names) so thats when I decided that I wanted to start studying.
                Computers and almost everything related to it has been an hobby since i was a kid.
                So I went in that direction and applied for this current program and I am certain I made the right choice.
                </p>
                
                    <p>I currently live with my parents in Kalmar because it keeps the costs down but I might consider
                    to move in with a friend in the upcoming future. 
                    </p>

            <h2>What did I do in Highschool?</h2>
            
                <p>I studied civics with focus on media on Stagneliusskolan in Kalmar which I really enjoyed.
                during thoose three years I made some filmprojects, some I'm proud of and some I'm not.
                </p>
                <p>Here are two bad examples of shortmovies I made.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/66556183">Den nya eleven</a></li>    
                    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxpdQK8ASkQ">Att bo p√• skolan</a></li>  
                </ul>
                <p>
                I had no experience of filmmaking so they are all with very low quality but with my sense of creativity and humour.
